# Text-to-Speech WebGPU

A simple React + Vite application for running [OuteTTS](https://github.com/edwko/OuteTTS), an experimental text-to-speech model that uses a pure language modeling approach to generate speech, using Transformers.js and WebGPU-acceleration.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the examples repository from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js-examples.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your working directory to the `text-to-speech-webgpu` folder:

```sh
cd transformers.js-examples/text-to-speech-webgpu
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```sh
npm i
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running locally. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see it in action.
